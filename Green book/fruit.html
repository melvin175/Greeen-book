                    <h3>Why love plants?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Why not? With all the varieties of tree's presenting their beauty to the human 
                        eyes independently scattered and beautifully arranged to heighten the mood stimulations 
                        of happy thoughts. A study looking at the most calming image found the combination of green 
                        plants and blue water to be the most attractive and calming.

                        Plants are healthy. They promote health and well-being as well as you 
                        getting to nurture something alive. It's so cool to plant something in 
                        the ground, fertilize, water, and care for it all while watching it grow 
                        and bloom. I love my plants. They help people with stress and anxiety, too.

                <h3>My Work</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve always had this strange fascination with trees.
                    They have this relentless consistency that is like gravity,
                    all-powerful and unnoticed. Existing as a given.
                    Trees grow.
                    They seek water and sunlight without the burdens and 
                    insecurities of human thought. Their mission is pure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plants are also a central part of a wide variety of more 
                    modern art, such as arabesque, still life paintings etc.
                    They have fascinated artists for years they’re in the art 
                    of the ancient Egyptians, and the Chinese. Photographing plants 
                    is a rewarding activity for any photographer. Well I don't know 
                    how it works for others but it is for me.
