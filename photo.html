                    <p>
                        Birds are the one good thing in this dark and cold world.
                        They sing and have a world of their own that can be understood if observed.
                        They can warm the saddest of heart and comfort.
                        They are all unique and play a big part in our ecosystem.
                        I’ve always liked birds but only recently took a deeper interest. 
                        Birds are the only animals with feathers with constant body temperature.
                        They lay eggs that have hard shells. About 10 thousand species of birds 
                        are known.

                        Anyways, I’m glad I decided to get into bird watching and photographing them also
                        learning more about them. Build your home so that it is wildlife friendly i
                        f you can and you will be rewarded.

                    Birds are mostly delightful, many are quite intelligent, 
                    most are beautiful in some way (even the "bin chickens"), 
                    and some have quite funny personalities. They are very social 
                    and their behaviour is fascinating to watch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love it when a wild bird approaches me, 
                    either deliberately hoping for a feed, or accidentally - because 
                    it has not noticed me, or is not afraid anyway.
                    Oh, and my work capturing them, help me get to know them in 
                    a very astonishing way and they never fail to fascinate me!
