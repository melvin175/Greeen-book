                    <h3>Why do we love Antiques?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Collecting antiques is a passion shared by many people, 
                        from the casual collector to the serious dealer. Despite 
                        the modern “Ikea” age of convenience (or perhaps because of
                        it), the enthusiasm with which people seek out 
                        these historic treasures remains undiminished.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By evoking the essence of a bygone era, antiques bring us closer
                        to the past. They help us learn about history in a formal sense, 
                        but also create a sense of nostalgia for another time.

                    Photographing the Antiques in sooth falls under the genre of product 
                    Photography. Lifestyle product photography is the practice of photographing
                    your product within a curated and styled scene. Chances of people finding Antiques
                    as valuable resource is less but as a photographer its our job to bring the best 
                    out of any product that's been photographed.
                </p>

                    My love for Antiques drag me towards its richness which I try to capture
                    and let people know the perspective with which I see them!
